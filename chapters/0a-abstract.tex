\chapter*{Abstract}

The abstract should be an extremely condensed version of the thesis. Think one sentence with the main message from each of the chapters of the body matter as a starting point. \textcite{landes1951scrutiny} have given some very nice instructions on how to write a good abstract. A thesis from a Norwegian Univeristy should contain abstracts in both Norwegian and English irrespectively of the thesis language (typically with the thesis language coming first).
