\chapter{Introduction}
The introduction of the thesis should take the reader all the way from the big picture and context of the project to the concrete task that has been solved in the thesis. A nice skeleton for a good introduction was given by \textcite{claerbout1991scrutiny}: \emph{review–claim–agenda}. In the review part, the background of the project is covered. This leads up to your claim, which is typically that some entity (software, device) or knowledge (research questions) is missing and sorely needed. The agenda part briefly summarises how your thesis contributes.
